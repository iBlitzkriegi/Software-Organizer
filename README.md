# Features 
* Software-Organizer is written to be lightweight and fast, you will be able to navigate through your categories
and open your programs quickly and efficiently. 
* All your data is saved on every action you take, so you can close the program at any time and it will be the same way you left it when you re-open it.
* Very, very low resources needed. This can just be left open in the background and tabbed back into whenever you want to open another program/game.
* Images are displayed with antialiasing and the highest possible quality to look nice and smooth in their circles.
* A in-depth tutorial/walkthrough when you first open the program.

# How to install 
1) Download the latest version from https://github.com/iBlitzkriegi/Vixio/releases/latest
2) Just run the exe and select an install folder
3) Then navigate to the install folder and open the SoftwareOrganizer.exe file in the folder. 

**IMPORTANT NOTICE:**
If you want to re-locate the exe for an easier place to click it, like your desktop or something. Make a SHORTCUT of the SoftwareOrganizer.exe file, do not re-locate the main exe because it needs to stay in it's working directory to run correctly.
